Hi! I'm May 👋 I dig data, love coding, and live in Bangkok 🇹🇭

I’m learning SQL, Python, Power BI, Google BigQuery, and building real-world projects to sharpen my skills in data wrangling, visualization, and storytelling. I’m also getting hands-on with tools like Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, and Git to build a strong foundation in analytics.

Previously, I worked in recruitment, hiring tech and finance professionals across the APAC and MENA regions. Being around so many brilliant minds in tech sparked my interest in data and it’s been a rewarding journey ever since.

I love:

- 🧠 Writing code & automating things  
- 📊 Making clean, insightful dashboards  
- 📦 Working with real-world messy datasets  
- 💥 Breaking things until I understand them  

When I’m not learning/ coding, I’m probably:

- Training Muay Thai 🥊  
- Doing Hyrox, hiking or exploring a trail ⛰️  
- Cooking healthy meals 🍳  
- Or travelling 🌍  

Let’s connect!
