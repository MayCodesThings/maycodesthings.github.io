Hi! I'm May 👋 I dig data, love coding, and live in Bangkok 🇹🇭

I’m building projects with **SQL**, **Python**, **Power BI**, and **Tableau** to clean, analyze, and visualize data that drives decisions. My work focuses on data wrangling, dashboard building, and storytelling using tools like **Jupyter**, **Pandas**, and **Tableau**. I love turning messy datasets into clear, valuable insights.

Before transitioning into data, I worked in recruitment, hiring tech and finance professionals across the APAC and MENA regions. Being around so many brilliant minds in tech sparked my interest in data and it’s been a rewarding journey ever since.

❤️ What I love:

- 🧠 Writing code & automating things  
- 📊 Making clean, insightful dashboards  
- 📦 Working with real-world messy datasets  
- 💥 Breaking things until I understand them  

When I’m not learning/ coding, I’m probably:

- Training Muay Thai 🥊  
- Doing Hyrox, hiking or exploring a trail ⛰️  
- Cooking healthy meals 🍳  
- Or travelling 🌍  

Thanks for stopping by — always happy to connect 😊
