ðŸ“š **Study Project â€“ freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python **

In this project, I explored U.S. demographic data using Pandas. The dataset included fields such as age, race, sex, education level, working hours, and salary. I performed various filtering and grouping operations to uncover trends related to income, education, and occupation.

ðŸ“Œ **Scope of Work**
- Count each race's representation  
- Calculate average age of men  
- Determine education level impact on income  
- Identify minimum work hours and high earners  
- Find countries with the highest percentage of high earners  
- Determine top occupations for high earners in India

ðŸ§  **Key Techniques Used**
- `pandas.read_csv()`, `groupby()`, `value_counts()`, `mean()`, `count()`  
- Conditional filtering (`df[df['sex'] == 'Male']`)  
- Logical operations (`&`, `|`)  
- Sorting and extracting top N results  
- String and percentage formatting
