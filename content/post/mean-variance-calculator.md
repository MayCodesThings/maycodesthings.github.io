ðŸ“š **Study Project â€“ freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python **

This was the first project in the freeCodeCamp data analysis certification. The goal was to write a Python function that calculates key statistics â€” **mean, variance, standard deviation, min, max, and sum** â€” across **rows, columns, and the flattened version** of a 3Ã—3 matrix.

ðŸ§  **What I Learned**
- How to manipulate matrices with NumPy  
- How to use functions like `.mean()`, `.var()`, `.std()`  
- How to reshape and flatten arrays  
- How to structure results clearly using Python dictionaries

---

ðŸ›  **Scope of Work**
- Accept a list of 9 values as input  
- Reshape the list into a 3x3 NumPy matrix  
- Compute each statistic across:
  - Columns (axis 0)
  - Rows (axis 1)
  - The full flattened matrix  
- Return all results in a dictionary format

ðŸ“Œ **Example Input**
```python
calculate([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
```
