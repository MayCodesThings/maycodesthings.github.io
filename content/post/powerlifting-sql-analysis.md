Summary: "A fun SQL project exploring trends and top performers in a powerlifting dataset."
---

In this project, I dove into a powerlifting dataset using SQL and pulled out cool insights like top lifters, age group trends, and performance improvements. This was a great way to sharpen my SQL skills while working with sports data. 🏆

### 📊 Average Lift by Type  
What's the average amount lifted for each type of lift?  
🔗 [See SQL query](https://github.com/yourusername/powerlifting-sql-project/blob/main/powerlifting_analysis.sql#L1)

---

### 💪 Heaviest Lift per Lifter  
For each lifter, what was their max lift ever?  
🔗 [See SQL query](https://github.com/yourusername/powerlifting-sql-project/blob/main/powerlifting_analysis.sql#L8)

---

### 🥇 Who Lifted the Most Overall?  
The total weight lifted by each person—and the #1 overall.  
🔗 [See SQL query](https://github.com/yourusername/powerlifting-sql-project/blob/main/powerlifting_analysis.sql#L15)

---

### ⚖️ Lifts by Weight Class  
How many lifts came from each weight class?  
🔗 [See SQL query](https://github.com/yourusername/powerlifting-sql-project/blob/main/powerlifting_analysis.sql#L23)

---

### 🔄 Multi-Lift Athletes  
Who performed more than one lift type?  
🔗 [See SQL query](https://github.com/yourusername/powerlifting-sql-project/blob/main/powerlifting_analysis.sql#L30)

---

### 📈 Who Improved Over Time?  
Tracking performance gains across age using window functions.  
🔗 [See SQL query](https://github.com/yourusername/powerlifting-sql-project/blob/main/powerlifting_analysis.sql#L37)

---

### 🏆 Best by Lift Type  
Top lifter per lift type (with weight class).  
🔗 [See SQL query](https://github.com/yourusername/powerlifting-sql-project/blob/main/powerlifting_analysis.sql#L50)

---

### 🧓 Average by Age Group  
Grouped lifters into age brackets (20–29, 30–39...) and calculated average lifts.  
🔗 [See SQL query](https://github.com/yourusername/powerlifting-sql-project/blob/main/powerlifting_analysis.sql#L64)

---

### 🔢 Normalize Weight Class  
Cleaned the weight class values to prep for numeric comparison.  
🔗 [See SQL query](https://github.com/yourusername/powerlifting-sql-project/blob/main/powerlifting_analysis.sql#L73)

---

### 🪜 Global Lift Ranking  
Ranked all lifts across the dataset by amount lifted.  
🔗 [See SQL query](https://github.com/yourusername/powerlifting-sql-project/blob/main/powerlifting_analysis.sql#L81)

### ✨ Final Thoughts  
This was a quick but solid SQL workout 💥. I enjoyed mixing sports and data—great for practicing `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`, `RANK()`, and `WINDOW FUNCTIONS`.

If you're learning SQL, I highly recommend trying this kind of **study project**!
