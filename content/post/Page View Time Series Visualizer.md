ðŸ“Œ **Scope of Work**
- Cleaned time series data by removing outliers (top/bottom 2.5%)  
- Created a line chart to display daily views  
- Generated a bar plot to compare average monthly views by year  
- Designed box plots to visualize seasonality and distribution across years and months

ðŸ§  **Key Techniques Used**
- Time series cleaning with Pandas  
- Line, bar, and box plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Date parsing and grouping by month/year  
- Outlier filtering for clear visualization
