## What’s This Project About?

I created a fun and interactive **HR Analytics Dashboard** using Tableau!  
It helps make sense of employee data like who's leaving, why they might be leaving, and what HR teams should keep an eye on

---

## 🔍 What You’ll Find in the Dashboard

- Breakdown of total employees and attrition rate  
- Department-wise attrition 
- Age and gender distribution  
- Education background and how it links to attrition  
- Job satisfaction across different roles  

---

## ✨ Key Takeaways

- **16.12%** of employees left, most of them from the **Sales** team  
- The age group with the highest attrition? **25–34 years old**  
- **Male employees** tend to leave more than female employees  
- Most employees come from **Life Sciences** and **Medical** backgrounds  
- Roles like **Sales Executive** and **Research Scientist** have mixed satisfaction levels — some love it, some… not so much
