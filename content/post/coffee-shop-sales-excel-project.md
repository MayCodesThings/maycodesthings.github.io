This was a fun little project where I used **Excel** to explore coffee shop sales data across different locations. The dataset is from [Maven Analytics](https://tinyurl.com/coffee-shop-data), and I built a dashboard that breaks down sales by time, product, and locationâ€”all in one page!

### What I did

- Cleaned and prepped the raw data  
- Created **pivot tables** to summarize sales by month, day, hour, and category  
- Used **slicers** to filter by store location  
- Designed a dashboard with charts that show:  
  - Monthly revenue trends  
  - Busiest days and hours  
  - Product categories with the most transactions  
  - Top-selling items by volume and revenue

### What I Used

Just **Excel**â€”pivot tables, charts, slicers, and some basic cleaning. Nothing too fancy, but super effective when you want something quick and clean!

Itâ€™s clean, easy to read, and actually pretty useful. If youâ€™re running a small shop, dashboards like this can help you spot trends, track whatâ€™s working, and see which products people keep coming back for.
