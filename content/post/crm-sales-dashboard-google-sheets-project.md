As part of my learning journey into data analytics, I built this CRM Sales Dashboard using **Google Sheets**. This was a hands-on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project from [Maven Analytics](https://tinyurl.com/crm-sales-data
), where I explored a sales opportunities dataset to uncover insights into team performance and win trends across quarters.

## ðŸ”§ What I Did

- Cleaned and merged data from two sources (`sales_pipeline.csv` and `sales_teams.csv`)  
- Created pivot tables to analyze **opportunities won/lost by quarter and sales agent**  
- Sorted quarterly performance to always highlight the most recent results  
- Built an interactive dashboard featuring:  
  - **Scorecard** showing total opportunities won vs. previous quarter  
  - **Pie chart** for win percentage  
  - **Bar chart** ranking top sales agents  
  - **Slicers** for filtering by region and manager  
- Arranged all visuals into a simple and dynamic layout
