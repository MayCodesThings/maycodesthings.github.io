Hi! I'm May 👋 - a recent career switcher from tech recruitment, where I worked as a Regional Consultant across APAC & MENA 🌍

I’m now focused on building a career in data analytics. I’m learning SQL, Python, Excel, Power BI, and Looker Studio, while working on hands-on projects to strengthen my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. 

This space is where I share my learning journey, projects, and insights as I transition into the data field.

If you're just starting out or considering a similar shift, I hope you’ll find something helpful or inspiring here.✨
